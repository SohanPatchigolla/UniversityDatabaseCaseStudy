# Abstract

In this case study on University Database, we have depicted the various relations in GITAM. In GITAM database, we start by taking a class called University which helps us to differentiate the data flow between the three campuses. Next, we have the various Departments on each campus ranging from CSE to Medical. Each department has its own Faculty members teaching various Subjects.

Now comes the most important entity in the entire University, Students. The students Enroll in various subjects taught by the respective faculty. Furthermore, the students are graded based on their performance in their respective Examinations.

We have also created Student Log relation to keep track of updates to the student database.

Finally, we have the relation Accounts between the student and the university. The students pay fee as per their course and scholarship.

We created this particular case study as a specific model for GITAM university but it can be scaled up for more universities with the same model design.
